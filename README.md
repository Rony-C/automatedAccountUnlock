# automatedAccountUnlock
Using Google Sheets API and Selenium to check if an account can be unlocked. This was a small project I created to learn Google Sheets API and Selenium. I wanted to start looking into automations and accessing information in an easy way

User ID and reactivation date were stored in a google sheet in the format "User ID -> Re-activation date"
Login credentials for the accounts admin are stored in a .yml file

I am working on removing the re-activated accounts with the Google Sheets API at a later date.
